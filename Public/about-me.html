    <h1>About me</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>
        Hey there, I'm Finn, a 31-year-old tech enthusiast on a journey of constant discovery. 
        Right now, I'm knee-deep in the world of Computer Science at Arden University, 
        getting my hands dirty with HTML, Java, and CSS. 
        It's like unlocking a whole new universe of possibilities every time I write a line of code.
    </p>
    <p>But hey, life's not all about programming! When I'm not glued to my screen, 
        you can catch me out in nature, hiking up a storm. Or I might be back at my PC screen diving into some video games, 
        currently I am deep into 'Baldurs Gate 3'.
        And oh, I love nothing more than being the brains behind a Dungeons and Dragons 
        adventure—imagination knows no bounds there! 
        Plus, I've got this thing for Japanese culture and language—because 
        why not add a bit of linguistic flair to the mix, right? I have been studying Japanese for about 4 months now, 
        progress has been slow but I can read and write Hiragana and Katakana. While I may not be natively fluent yet, 
        if you ever need someone to ask directions to the nearest train station or toilet in Japanes... I am your man. 
    </p>

        So yeah, that's me. Finn, 
        the tech geek with a love for adventure and a hunger for learning. If you wish to know any more, 
        please get in touch via my <a href="./contact.html">contact page</a> 
        or feel free to read through my <a href="../index.html">experience and skills.</a>
